# Category related content

<p class="lead">Learn which outline tags help you describe category items. From basic expand and collapse categories to showing an auto-generated index when clicking the category label. Additionally, describe a category that will show a page when users click the category label. A much easier process than editing the sidebars.js file!</p>





## Basic category

A basic category behavior involves expanding or collapsing its pages.


## Auto generated index

Create a category that will show a content page with links to its pages. It generates sidebars.js content that Docusaurus uses to create the auto generated index.
